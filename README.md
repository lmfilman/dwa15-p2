# README for Project 2

## Description:
A simple PHP web application which generates unique passwords inspired by the XKCD comic here: http://xkcd.com/936/.  The application allows users to specify the number of words and other options such as whether to include a number or special character.  The application also demonstrates simple user input error handling.
## Extra details:
The password word list came from the following external source: http://www.curlewcommunications.co.uk/wordlist.html
